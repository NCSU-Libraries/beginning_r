  R Studio provides an easy way to interact with R. R is a command line and scripted 
  tool and R Studio doesn't change that. It does make it much easier to see what is 
  going on though. This unit will give you a quick introduction to the main 
  features of R Studio so we can get moving on learning R next.

R Studio is an Integrated Developement Environment (IDE) for R. An IDE is really just a tool
that brings several components that are useful for working with a programming language. It
is entirely possible to work with R successfully using only the command line in your
terminal and many people do work that way. However, most people find it easier to user
an IDE like R Studio.

To get started, start R Studio. If it doesn't start you off with a project, go to 
**_File/New Project..._**. Then click **New Directory**, **New Project**, 
enter `learning_R` as the **Directory name: ** and click **Create Project**. The R 
Studio environment can be divided into four regions, labeled A, B, C and D (fig. 1). 
Each of these areas have a broad function, most of them with several tabs. We'll go 
through each one quickly to get us started.

### The Console

The first area to look at is the console (Area C). This is your primary way to 
interact with R and is exactly the same as typing R commands into a terminal. We'll 
be working with this a lot, but to try it out try typing the following into the prompt.

```r 

> 1   # Type this in
[1] 1  # The response.

> 1 + 1
[1] 2

> 1 == 1
[1] TRUE

```

### Script and Data Viewer

You may not have an Area A yet. To see it click the small green plus icon  
<img src="/assets/img/units/new_script.png" alt="The new file button" width="35"/> at the top left
of the window and choose **R Script**. You'll see a blank script document.  Whereas
you run commands in the console one by one, you can collect these commands
into a script and rerun them all any time you like. Type the following into your 
script then click the **Source** button 
<img src="/assets/img/units/source_button.png" alt="The source button" width="75"/>.

> NOTE: You need to use the `print()` function to tell R to write the result to the 
> console.

```r

print(1)
print(1 + 1)
print(1 == 1)

```

You can also run a script line by line. Click on any line to put the cursor then and 
click the **Run** button 
<img src="/assets/img/units/run_button.png" alt="The run button" width="52"/>. You will see only that result ouput.


### Environment and Memory

Area B displays primarily things that are stored in the computer's memory. Memory is
the ephemeral information that a computer keeps while it is running. In contrast to
a computer disk, flash drive or similar devices, information stored in the memory 
is lost when you close a program or turn the computer off. R actually saves these values 
to disk when you close R, so long as you save your environment when closing though. 
Values assigned to variables, data and many other things are stored in memory. 
Also the history of your interactions with the console are shown here. To try it out 
type the following into the console.

```r

> var <- "This is my variable"

```

Click on the **Environment** tab if it isn't already active. You should see that
the text has been committed to memory and assigned to the variable named `var`. If you 
click on the **History** tab, you will see a record of all the things you have typed into
the console. We won't be exploring the **Connections** tab, but it keeps track of 
various database and other external resources you may have connected to.


### Storage 

Area D mostly handles things that are stored on your disk drives and other storage
devices. These persist even when you close R or turn your computer off. There are
several tabs here. We'll interact with them all during the tutorial and just
touch briefly on them here.

<dl>
  <dt>Files: </dt>
  <dd>lists and allows you to interact with the files in your
  project directory.</dd>
  <dt>Plots: </dt>
  <dd>shows your recent visualizations and plots. These are not stored as files 
  but are actually in memory.</dd>
  <dt>Packages: </dt>
  <dd>Shows what packages you have installed. If the checkbox is checked, then it 
  is also loaded into memory and ready to use. More on packages later.</dd>
  <dt>Help</dt>
  <dd>Displays the help files associated with the different functions and packages
  you will be using.</dd>
  <dt>Viewer: </dt>
  <dd>Displays other types of content you may generate, such as web pages.</dd>
  
</dl>
